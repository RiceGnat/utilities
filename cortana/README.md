Custom voice commands for Cortana

cortana-uri
==============
Handler that accepts a URI string and runs the appropriate command.

Universal Windows Platform apps are not permitted to directly run executables or scripts. Instead, the handler must be associated with a custom URI protocol which the Cortana command service will launch.
